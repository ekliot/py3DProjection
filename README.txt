This is a projet to draw a wireframe cube from any angle in an orthographic perspective

Future plans:
-CUBE
--solid cube [determine faces using corners, three faces with greatest z-value for center are shaded in]
---shading [determine light source, darken obscured faces]
----shadow [?]
--other polyhedrons [determine function for coordinates for corners of polyhedron with n faces]
--other projections [perspective projection]

-MATRICES
--different matrix operations
--more matrix variety
